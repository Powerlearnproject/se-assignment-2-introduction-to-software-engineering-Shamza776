# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering is mainly related to computer and programming and developing different applications.It mainly involves computer science, information technology and discete mathematics. Software Engineering differs from the traditional engineering in several ways, but the main one is that, the traditional programming is highly based on empirical knowledge and is about building cars, machines and hardware. It mainly involves science and mathematics.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Initiation - involves defining project goals and objectives and identifying stakeholders.
2. Planning - here we define the scope, schedule and budget. A project management plan is developed.
3. Execution - tasks are then assigned to team members to implement the project plans.
4. Monitoring and Controllinh - tracking of the project progress takes place and report the perfomance to stakeholders.
5. Closure - finalize all project activities and obtain formal acceptance of deliverables. 


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile: is an iterative and incremental approach to software  development that emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback while Waterfall: in this type of methodology each phase nust be completed before the next begins. This is actually the main difference.Another is agile is quick to respond to changes while waterfall is difficult to accomodate changes. A simple example where each methodology maybe preferred is: Agile, evolving product: a software company enhancing an existing product with regular updates and new features. Waterfall:  Construction Projects: building a new office complex where all requirements, materials and designs are known upfront.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering involves the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements for a software system according to the needs of a stakeholder. Process includes: planning, gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops and observations etc
2. Analysis: Refining and prioritizing requirements to resolve conflicts and resume feasibility.
3. Specification: involves documenting the requirements in a clear, detailed and unambiguos manner.
4. Validation: ensure that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.
5. Management: keeping track of requirements as they evolve managing changes and ensuring traceability.

The importance in the SDLC is that there is Clarity of what the system should do, Alignment between the stakeholder's needs and expectations and Scope control: what will and will not be included.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the design principle of dividing a software system into distict, manageable and independent components called modules which encapsulates a specific functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.It improves maintainability by Isolation of changes where changes in one module does not affect others, it is also easy to debug and iy has simplified testing hence easy to maintain and scale systems. Teams can also work on differents modules silmutaneously speeding up development process hence easy scaling,.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing - involves the testing of individual components or functions of the software.
2. Intergration testing - tests the interactions between intergrated units.
3. System testing - tests ythe complete intergrated system ensuring it meets specified requirements.
4. Acceptance testing - it validates the software against user requirements.
The importance of testing is allows for error detection before releasing it, it reduces risk and ensures sotware meets specifications and fulfills intended purpose.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
These are tools that help manage changes to source code over time by tracking revisions allowing multiple developers to collabrote. It's importance in software development is: it allows collaboration, history tracking, backup and recovert and also branching and merging of the developers' work. Examples of popular VCS are Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce Helix Core.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?A software project manager oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects.The key responsibilities include: Project Planning, Team coordination, risk management, communcation, quality assurance etc, and some of the challenges faced are time management: meeting tight deadlines while ensuring quality. Technology changes during the development can also be a challenge.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? software maintenance refers to the activities involved in modifying and updating software after its initial deployment. Types of maintenance activities: 
1. Corrective maintenance: fixes bugs and defects ensuring the software continues to operate as intended.
2. Adaptive maintenance: involves modifying software to adapt to changes e.g new os or hardware, keeping the software compatible with evolving technological ecosystems.
3. Preventive maintenance: involves making changes to prevent potential future problems.
4. Perfective maintenance: enhances existing features or adds new ones to improve software perfomance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
some issues faces are Privacy: hndling user data responsibly ensuring no misuse, Security: where the implement ribust security measures to protect data from breaches and attacks.
also transparency: involves providing clear and accurate information about software capabilities. Some of the ways they adhere to the ethical standards are by following code of thics, maintaining open and honest communcation with the stakeholders and also keeping thorough documentation of decisions and processes to ensure transparency.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
